# Movie database

Perform some queries on a Movie database for somespecific questions.

## Understanding

We have a dataset of 3000 movies from the internet movie database here. This dataset includes columns such as title, genre, budget, production companies, cast, etc. Using only the information provided in this dataset, answer the following questions. (Dataset may require cleaning first)

## Requirements

1.	Which are the genres with the highest number of movies? (Note that a movie may have more than one genre)
2.	Which are the genres with the highest average revenue/budget ratio for a movie? (i.e. which genres are the most rewarding ones in terms of income for the company?)
3.	Sort the production companies by the number of movies made. (Note that a movie may have more than one production company)
4.	Provide a plot of average revenue/budget ratio in different years. (X-axis would be years and Y-axis would be the average revenue/budget ratio)
5.	Group all movies into different subgroups based on budget, revenue and popularity. (Drop the movies with budget or revenue lower than 10000, these are unknown values)
Explain how you choose the number of these groups. Can you provide an explanation about each group?
6.	We have some users who like to be different and ‘swim against the current’. Find them the most weird movies in terms of runtime, budget, number of cast, etc. Feel free to improvise and combine the columns! Explain your results.
